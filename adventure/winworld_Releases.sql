This was made not only to remove doubts of Windows being *vaporware*, but to also solicit feedback and partially deliver on a promise from Steve Balmer to ship in the summer of 1985. Many of individuals worked night and day, 7 days a week, with [Gabe Newell](http://valvesoftware.com) even sleeping in his office.

Important: Due to enhancements in the IDE driver, you usually will want to install from SP4 media. ', 'The final RTM build of Windows 2000 is **5.0.2195** which arrived with new NTFS 3.0 support, an on-the-fly Encrypting File System, new Accessibility tools and the Active Desktop, additional language and locale settings.  Dynamic disks were introduced as well which allowed Windows to join disks together in a software RAID array.  Plug-and-play support was improved compared to Windows NT 4.0.

One noticeable fact right off the bat is that features from [Windows 98](/product/windows-98) have made it into the Windows NT line, like the Active Desktop update, Internet Explorer 5, Windows Driver Model, Internet Connection Sharing, Windows Media Player and WebDAV support.  Windows File Protection also arrived with 2000 which protected critical system files by not allowing anything other than Microsoft''s Windows Installer or Windows Update package installer modify system files.  The System File Checker utility allowed users to preform a manual scan of protected system files (and optionally repair them).  Windows 2000 also supported ACPI S4 hibernation, which unlike Windows 98, does not require specific vendor drivers.

For system management Windows 2000 introduced the Microsoft Management Console and a vast majority of system administration tools from Windows NT 4.0 were moved to MMC ''snap-ins''.  This includes the the Event Viewer, Task Scheduler, COM+ management, group policy configuration, disk defragmenter, device manager, service control, and if installed, .NET Framework. Two versions of the registry editor exist in Windows 2000.  The classic MDI-style editor capable of manipulating Windows NT permissions exists as regedt32.exe and the Windows 98 registry editor exists as regedit.exe.  This is a straight port and is incapable of editing a remote registry or changing permissions.  This was later updated in Windows XP.  A new recovery console was introduced which can be launched from the CD-ROM (or optionally installed to disk and made available through NTLDR by running `WinNT32.exe /cmdcons` in Windows).  This is a text-mode Windows NT (and not MS-DOS as it may look) environment.  Most of what is built into cmd.exe, along with a set of NT native mode utilities may be launched from the recovery console.

Features on the fun consumer side (or further brought over from 98) is support for DirectX 7.0, which is able to be upgraded up to DirectX 9.0c (Shader 3.0) with support remaining in DirectX up to the June 2010 SDK.  Windows 2000 included no new stock games, including only FreeCell, Minesweeper, Pinball and Solitaire.  Windows 2000 included the Accessibility tools (which NT 4.0 did not) and also included some new tools.  Ported over was StickyKeys, FilterKeys, ToggleKeys, SoundSentry, MouseKeys, high contrast themes, and Magnifier.  Windows 2000 introduced the Narrator, which reads aloud GUI objects with the Speech API, and an on screen keyboard which works with mouse or joystick.  Windows 2000 introduced a multilingual user interface and can support Arabic, Armenian, Baltic, Central European, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Indic, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkic, Vietnamese and Western European languages.  Numerous locale settings are supported.', 'Windows', null);

The File Manager was completely revamped and a revamped hypertext help system was introduced.  

Applications could talk to each other not only through the DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol, also used by OS/2, but also by the new Windows-only OLE protocol which allows for applications to share any type of object more seamlessly.  Write, Paintbrush and the new Object Packager have support for this technology which remains with us today in Windows 8.

Windows 3.1 also came with support for TrueType fonts which provide more realistic font rendering as they are outline fonts that can scale to any point size.  With TrueType users could finally have a good grasp that what was shown on the screen would be what was printed without blocky outlines.  TrueType survives today along with its close cousin OpenType.

Multimedia support was now fully integrated along with the expandable Control Panel into Windows 3.1.  In Windows 3.0 this was provided by a Multimedia PC add-on which usually came with new Multimedia PCs, sound cards and CD-ROM drives of the day.  Common supported cards include Adlib and Sound Blaster 16.

<span class="label label-danger">BETA</span> During development Windows 3.1 was under the development codename *****Janus***** and 3 prerelease versions have surfaced, two beta candidates and a release candidate.  The final beta was compiled on December 17, 1991 and expects a BIOS date of the 18th or later.  Purple was replaced with blue and the boot screen was overhauled to the modern 3.1 variant.

Windows 3.2 was a Chinese language specific release. The only difference from 3.1 was additional support for Chinese characters and was released in late 1993.

simply a floppy disk with data files on it.  Once the virus is on 
the hard disk, it will infect every floppy that you put in your 
computer, thereby creating further infections that help it 
continue to spread.</p>

For PCT-9 SERIES Including the ATC-8 and the ATC-16 interfaces.

The Catamount 1/2 inch Magnetic Tape Sub-systems are designed to
provide access to, and use of, 1/2 inch magnetic tape data from the
IBM PC/XT/AT and PS/2 computers and 100% compatibles. The Catamount
subsystems support the IBM and ANSI compatible NRZI (Non-Return to
Zero Invert) format at 800 bpi (Bits per inch), the PE (Phase
encoded) data recording formats at 1600 and 3200 bpi, and the GCR
(Group Coded Records) format at 6250 bpi depending on which subsystem
have you purchased.

The Standard Catamount subsystem consists of a tape drive, a desk-top
enclosure, an interface card, data cable and software. The Catamount
interface is a full function DMA interface allowing access to all
features of the Catamount tape drive. The Catamount interface
occupies one expansion slot on the computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I/O channel.

A single data cable connects the interface card to either pair of P1
and P2 connectors on the rear of the tape drive.

Up to eight tape drives may be attached in a daisy-chain fashion to a
single Catamount interface. Each tape drive attached in this fashion
must be separately addressed and the termination resistor packs
removed from all but the last drive in the chain.

The Catamount Subsystems are supplied standard with five software
packages. These software packages are used for data transfer to and
from tape; backing up and restoring from floppy, hard disk or network
drive; and custom program support.

DT

The DT program is used to copy data to and/or from magnetic tape to
and/or from a DOS device, such as a disk drive or a printer. The DT
program provides record blocking/deblocking, tab expansion and
contraction, trailing blank removal or padding, carriage return 
and/or line feed Insertion and removal, ASCII/EBCDIC translation and 
tape positioning for copied data.

TBACKUP and TRESTORE 

The TBACKUP and TRESTORE programs are used to create tape backup
copies of disk flies. These commands function in a manner very 
similar to the DOS supplied BACKUP and RESTORE commands. Support is 
provided for tree structured directories, multiple disk drives, file 
selection by archive bit and date of last modification, global file 
names, multi-reel backups, file classification and file exclusion. 
Additional utilities are provided to scratch the backup tapes and to 
list directory Information from the backup tapes.

TPS 

The TDS (Tape Device Support) software provides DOS with additional
devices used to transfer data to and from tape. One (or more, if 
additional tape drives are In- stalled) block device(s) and one (or 
more) character devlce(s) are added to the system, with the 
additional block device(s) providing data as files that can be 
accessed through conventional operating system calls. ASCII/EBCDIC 
translation, record deblocking, trailing blank removal or padding, 
tab expansion and contraction, carriage return and line feed 
Insertion and removal are selectable as options. These devices are 
controlled through DOSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IOCTL facility.

BPS 

The BPS (BASIC Programming Support) software provides a simplified
and fast method of accessing tape data through the BASIC language.
String data is passed via the USR function to and from the tape
drive. The BPS software provides optional ASCII/EBCDIC translation as
well as record blocking and deblocking.

GPTR

The GPTR (General Purpose Tape Routines) Is a library of machine
language subroutines designed to be LINKed to other (usually high
level language) programs, and provide access to standard tape drive
functions. The GPTR subroutines are accessed by other programs when
LINKed via the DOS LINK utility. The GPTR package is derived from the
BPS software and provides similar features.

from any windows application. To be able to send faxes, select MEWPRN
as your default printer driver from your application, print the
documents to be faxed and supply the phonebook details asked at the
time of printing. CMEWFAX will capture the print output, convert it
into fax files and start sending them to the selected recipients. To
receive faxes from anybody, enable the receive option in the
Configuration after selecting the correct serial port and the modem
type. Once you have MultiExpress waiting for ring, if any fax call
comes in EMEWFAX will automatically answer the call, receive the fax
and put it in the receive log. With MEWFAX, you can view your faxes
while receiving, print them on receive, or forward to others.

MEWFAX not only supports serial ports, but also MCSI and NASI
compatible async servers. So, you can select any MCSI line for
sending and receiving your faxes. MEWFAX allows you to annotate the
faxes received by you with the special annotator tool before
forwarding them to others. You can also design your own coverpages
using the coverpage designer tool, which can be used while sending
faxes to others. In addition to printing from applications, any ASCII
text files, PCX files, bitmap files or TIFF files can be directly
submitted from MEWFAX which will be converted and queued for sending.
MEWFAX allows you to share the serial port as well as the modem with
MEW terminal without any special changes.

MultiExpress Terminal for Windows allows you to connect to any 
popular BBS, any mainframe or any other host which can be connected 
using a modem. It supports all the popular terminal emulations like 
ANSI, VT100, IBM 3101 etc., and many more. MEW Terminal supports 
ZMODEM, YMODEM, KERMIT, XMODEM and most of the popular file transfer 
protocols to allow you to upload and download files. You can choose 
your modem from a predefined list which covers all popular modems, or 
you can add your own modem configuration. You can have multiple 
terminals in different windows which can be connected to different 
hosts at the same time using different communication devices. 
Configurable toolbar, statusbar and functionbar allows you to tune 
the user interface to your taste. The easy to use phonebook and 
dialing directory allows you to call into any popular BBS without any 
problem.', 'Windows', null);

project management tool that approached projects using the "Critical
Path Method" (rather than PERT). It was primarily geared towards
resource, scheduling and costing aspects, and targeted business users
that had not used project management software before.

Notable features of Microsoft Project 1.0 included its ability to use
the Microsoft Mouse, and built in help.

This version competed with [VisiSchedule](/product/visischedule), [Harvard Project Manager](/product/total-project-manager), and PertMaster.

Project 1.00 for DOS was written by MAS and published by Microsoft.
Microsoft acquired all rights for 2.00 and later.

This application runs under PC/MS-DOS 1.1x or later, with 128K RAM, a
double sided 5.25" floppy drive, and a graphics adapter.

Note: This disk is formatted for DOS 1.x and will not open with tools
like Winimage.

Note: This disk is also mis-formatted with 9-sectors, even though it
is a 320k 8-sector image. This confuses most disk copiers, as well as
Windows 9x.

Important: This version is copy protected, and no unprotect is known
to exist. To create a working disk, you must write a disk using the
provided Kryoflux image. It may be converted to other formats, such
as SuperCard Pro, using the HxC disk tool. It has also been tested to
run in the PCE emulator.

It will run either from the A or B drive, but apparently can not be
installed to a hard drive. Extracted files are provided for
reference, but will not create a usable program disk.

1.00 includes a pre-release build of OS/2, Microsoft MASM and C 4.50 betas, and documentation for OS/2, Microsoft C, MASM, and OS/2 programming. 

The SDK also included (available here as a separate download) the [Microsoft Windows 1.04 SDK](/product/windows-sdk-ddk/windows-1x), [Windows 1.04](/product/windows-10/104), programming libraries, and [Microsoft C 4.0](/product/microsoft-c-c/40). Allegedly this was just to give developers an idea of how the OS/2 Presentation Manager would work. 

Wanted: Microsoft OS/2 SDK 1.00 Program Disk.  

August 1987 - SDK 1.01

1.01 consists of a single disk update, the OS/2 program disk, to the 1.00 set. 1.01 is only a minor change that adds a program selector. 1.01 also added pre-release documentation for "Windows Presentation Manager", although the software was not included until SDK 1.03. 

The 1.01 archive here contains the 1.01 program disk, as well as the May 1987 SDK 1.00 disks, but it is missing the 1.00 program disk (probably disk 1), and apparently another disk (disk 2, but it is not clear what should be on that disk). 

Wanted: Microsoft also released the Microsoft OS/2 DDK 1.00 at about the same time.
