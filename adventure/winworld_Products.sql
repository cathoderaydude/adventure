The earliest known appearance of "Microsoft Windows" was in a [1983 Byte Magazine](http://toastytech.com/guis/win1983.html), and it was heavily promoted at the [Fall 1983 Comdex](http://toastytech.com/guis/wincdx.html). It was marketed as a response to GUI environments such as [Digital Research GSX](https://forum.winworldpc.com/discussion/9862/software-spotlight-dr-graph-and-dr-draw), [VisiCorp Visi On](/product/visi-on/), and [Apple Macintosh](/product/mac-os-0-6/), although the first completed release was not until late 1985.

Windows 1.0x features co-operative multitasking, tiled windows, ability to launch and integrate with DOS programs, runs on top of existing DOS, supports 8088 based PCs with IBM CGA, Hercules Monochrome, and IBM EGA video.

Later editions of Windows 2 added support for 286 high memory, and running applications in a 386 VDM. The versioning is a little confusing. 2.x and 2.x/386 were released side-by-side. When it reached 2.1x, the regular 8088 version was renamed to Windows 2.1x/286. This is all unified in [Windows 3.0](/product/windows-3). 

For a brief time during the Windows 2.x era, Microsoft considered dropping Windows in favor of [OS/2](/product/os-2-1x). After a fallout between Microsoft and IBM, development refocused on [Windows 3.0](/product/windows-3) and what would become [Windows NT](/product/windows-nt-3x).

Windows ME was often criticized for its poor stability. Microsoft had made numerous internal changes at the device driver level. However with the news that this architecture was at an end, vendors did not update their Windows 98 drivers for Windows ME. While existing 98 drivers usually "worked", they were often buggy and unstable under ME. Additionally, users were becoming used to the increased stability of Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) and the new MacOS X. 

Although Windows ME still runs on top of DOS, just like Windows versions back to 1.01, it  crippled the ability to start up to or exit to DOS. Many Windows 95 and 98 users had relied on that, as many popular games and utilities were still DOS based. If you wish to set up an older computer for use with DOS programs, we recommend you use nothing later than Windows 98 SE. 

Feature-wise, Windows ME changes the desktop appearance to be on par with Windows 2000. It adds Windows Movie Maker, Internet Games, System Restore, Explorer Web View, Personalized Menus, and new common dialogs. 

Windows ME targeted the home market, while the NT-based Windows 2000 targeted the business market. Initiated during the Windows 2.0 days, Microsoft finally realized its dream of merging these two markets under one single, more powerful OS, with the release of Windows XP.

It competed against the Apple Macintosh, but beat Microsoft Windows to market. 

Apple sued Digital Research over their look and feel, which resulted in GEM 2.0 removing overlapping windows from its desktop file management. 

There were numerous applications written for the GEM Environment.

The final official release was GEM 3.11. Enhanced versions were included with Artline, TimeWorks Publisher, and ViewMax but were only intended for use as runtimes.

Miracle-driver from Panasonic Japan does the unthinkable

HAVING AN EXTERNAL USB cd-writer or hard disk works wonders as long as your operating system is in good shape. But if someday the system stops booting, you are lost. Booting from good old MS-DOS or Windows boot diskettes - even fitted with the needed third party NTFSDOS or EXTFS drivers - gives you access to your fixed hard disk only, but none of the USB peripherals can be accessed from the DOS command line. 
Before you start scratching your head, let me repeat that this is not related to your favorite linux distro''s or Windows XP/W2K/98/ME''s USB support, this has to do with people like me, booting some flavor of DOS to copy files around or using DOS-based partition back-up software. 

Imagine that you want to use Paragon Drive Backup, Powerquest''s Drive Image, or Norton Ghost, to backup your hard disk partitions to that nice 120gb external USB 2.0 hard disk you just bought. You can''t do it. Or if your wife/husband has managed to mess up her/his system so badly that it can''t boot anymore, yet she/he wants you to have a copy of those nice digital pictures stored on a compactflash card plugged into the compactflash reader?. No way, Jose. Not from DOS, used to be the phrase.

Well, now you CAN.

The minor miracle here is using a driver file called "USBASPI.SYS" ("Panasonic v2.06 ASPI Manager for USB mass storage"). Given the right parameter incantations, this 16-bit Panasonic-developed DOS driver will let your system boot good-old DOS -any flavour, maybe even Caldera''s OpenDOS and recognize all USB devices connected to the respective controllers. So this USB device identification is also useful for debugging/troubleshooting purposes. 

However, it should be noted that this driver will only map mass storage devices like external hard disks, cd- roms, cd-rw, dvd-rom, zip, jaz, ls-120, and flash memory to ASPI devices. Then you need an elusive "ASPI mass storage driver" to map HDs and flash disks it to a drive letter in DOS. This one goes by the name "di1000dd.sys", commonly referred to as the "Motto Hairu USB Driver". Don''t ask why, it''s called that, I don''t know.

It was then ported to a wide variety of platforms including the Apple III, TRS-80 series, Sony SMC-70, HP, Commodore, and Atari computers. It was one of the first commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981.

word processors, was born out of the lack of a decent IBM PC
editor/word processor. Textra featured a full set of text
manipulation commands, common text formatting abilities, and full
screen editing. It was specifically designed for the IBM PC, giving
it faster load and save times and the most responsive user interface
possible. It was priced much lower than most other text editors or
word processors.

For a time it was also sold through the W W Norton & Co Inc publishing company as [Norton Textra Writer](/product/norton-textra-writer).

embed graphics, includes a spell checker (but not in the demo) and

boilerplates, multilevel undo, page preview, and document import file
converters.

Like other standard Windows applications, it can share data between
most other Windows programs via the Windows Clipboard, and supports
all printers supported by Windows.

It was criticized for being slow compared to DOS programs due to the
overhead of Microsoft Windows, as well as requiring a mouse for some
operations rather than the keyboard. It was also priced rather high
for functionally comparable word processors.

applications [in summer
